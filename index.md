            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>National Research consultancy is inaugurated in the Manchester city of Tamilnadu, Coimbatore in the year 2015 with a motto of facilitating research community in the production of quality, accurate and effective research on time. Stepping into the sixth year, our consulting has helped scholars from various disciplines across the globe to produce 108 theses and 1217 research articles. Besides, the consultancy has helped around 500 scholars in copy editing, plagiarism removal, data analysis, collection of samples, literature review, topic selection, publication of research papers and statistical tools. All our services are purely original in the sense we never lift any previous research on the specific area. It is our commitment to our clients. We have a set of subject experts for each domain who are all doctorates in the respective branch. All works are done manually by the subject expert, reviewed by another expert and scanned for originality before handing over to the client. We follow a systematic and channelized process on all our assignments.</p>
